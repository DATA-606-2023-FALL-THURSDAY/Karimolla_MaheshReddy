## 2. Background
- Consumer sentiment evaluation is seldom a straightforward linear process; it involves a wide range of variables that affect users' moods and sentiments 
    as well as a variety of textual expression methods that vary from user to user.
-In order to do this, machine learning modeling and statistical data analysis techniques are effective tools for leveraging client sentiment while also evaluating the
     objectivity, dependability, and validity of various forms of customer feedback.
- Measures the inclination of peopleâ€™s opinions.
- Market analysis and customer feedback.
  

## Research Questions
- How can we discover and classify attitudes (multiclass classification) given a dataset of human comprehensible words (and grammar)?
- How should the criteria and method for feature extraction from the raw data be decided? Which hyperparameters are ideal?
- How can we extrapolate the outcomes of our sentiment analysis to allow for the creation of unsupervised text?
