## 2. Background
- Flight delays are a major issue in the aviation sector, causing aggravation for travelers and costing airlines money. Flight delays can happen for a number of causes, such as bad weather, technical problems, airport congestion, and air traffic control constraints.

- In addition to aggravating passengers, flight delays also increase traveler stress since they increase the cost of lodging and meals. The ensuing lack of trust in airlines may also hurt their reputation and lower demand from passengers. Airlines also spend more money on their crew, aircraft repositioning, and more fuel as a result of their efforts to reduce elapsed time.

  

## Research Questions
- Relationship between the average departure and arrival delay times for each airport.
- Distribution of the average delay by distance.
- to predict the upcoming delay.

## 3. Data 
- Data sources: The data has been collected from the Kaggle.
- Dataset contains U.S. flight data from 2009â€“2018. The rows of the dataset represent specific flights from that year, while the columns contain extensive information on the flight such as airline, flight date, departure delay, arrival delay, etc.
- The entire dataset contains CSV files for each year, which in total amass to ~7GB. Moreover, each file has approximately 6 million rows per year.

## Data Description
- The dataset contains flight information for a given year, including the month, day, and various attributes related to each flight.
- There are 24 columns in this dataset, with 3 columns of categorical data (OP_CARRIER, ORIGIN, and DEST), 4 columns of integer data (year, month, day, and OP_CARRIER_FL_NUM), and 17 columns of float data.


- Upcoming delay is the target variable in the project.
